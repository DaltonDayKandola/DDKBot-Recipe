Contributing to DDK Chatbot
============================

The DDK Chat Bot project operates an open contributor model where anyone is
welcome to contribute towards development in the form of peer review, testing
and updates. This document explains the practical process and guidelines for
contributing.

First, in terms of structure,  there are repository "maintainers" who are responsible for
merging pull requests, as well as a "lead maintainer" who is responsible for the
release cycle as well as overall merging, moderation and appointment of
maintainers.

Getting Started and Contribution Workflow
-----------------------------------------

New contributors are very welcome and needed to make the Chat Bot better.

There are many open issues of varying difficulty waiting to be fixed.
If you're looking for somewhere to start contributing, check out the list fo issues 
[up for grabs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22Up+for+grabs%22).

You can also participate in new ideas that you think will enhance the Chat Bot. Literally we would love to hear from you. To do this submit the change in a new branch and use a Pull Request with and explanation of what your idea is in it. We will review, have a chat in the PR and and if we reach a consensus,  merge it into the main branch and prep it for release.
