# How we made our DDK Bot

## Overview
[Micrsoft Azure ChatBot](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-service/) Services sits within thier AI and Machine Learnign space.

To put things into context here si a bto of a refreshjer on these terms:

>AI
>Machine Learning
>Deep Learning

and then we have the simple chat bot


While Chat Bots certainly draw on Machine Learning and in particular Deep Learning for its understanding of natural language, AI it is not. Infact no tools or techniques are AI in the traditional sense of getting anywhere near simulating the cognitive powers of the Human Brain.

Saying that though, Azure Chat Bots are fun and there is a comprehensive documentation  online to help and guid you through the simplest chat bot thats simply echos back what you say to to more sophisticated conversations involving machine learning.
